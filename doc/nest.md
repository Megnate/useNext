# Use nest.js documentation

## CLI

Use CLI to generate some nest files such as controller files by termenal.

- `nest g mo user` : generate a user model file is named `user.module.ts`

- `nest g co user` : generate user controller files are named `user.controller.ts` and `user.controller.spec.ts`

- `nest g s user` : generate user service files are named `user.service.ts` and `user.service.spec.ts`

- some files names use to test code include the string `spec.ts`

In addiction to above those files, we need to generate a new file which is named `user.model.ts` to store the user database structure.
